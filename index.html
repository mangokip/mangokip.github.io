        <p>
          When tackling the issue of networking problems within UofSC's network infrastructure, it is important to consider any and all aspects that would hinder the development of functional software and websites. As a group, we have pinpointed some root questions that may be asked that we will need to address. There are various solutions that must be found, pricing that needs to be determined prior, restraints that prevent the full potential of our network from blooming, and figuring out long term support as an institution. With this, there are constants that will always be in consideration.

        <h2>Problem Statement: UofSC Registration Site </h2>
        <p>
          Students at the Columbia campus for the University of South Carolina aim to improve the functionality of the University's registration site, as network and overflow errors are prevalent during times of registration which is a problem due to the already limited seating in classes and scheduling.
