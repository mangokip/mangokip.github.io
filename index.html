        <h2>Problem Statement: UofSC Registration Site </h2>
        <p>
          Students at the Columbia campus for the University of South Carolina aim to improve the functionality of the University's registration site, as network and overflow errors are prevalent during times of registration which is a problem due to the already limited seating in classes and scheduling.
